# Advent of Code

Contains my code for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023.

## Project Structure

`src` contains a directory for each day.
Those directories contain a class (`DayXX.php`), the input (`input.txt`), and the
prompt (`prompt.md`).
The runner will solve both part 1 and part 2 and output the solutions to the console.
[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) was used to test the solutions during development.

## Caution

Try to not use these solutions to cheat in Advent Of Code.
Feel free to use them as inspiration though if you get stuck!

From the official FAQ:

> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't
> full yet, and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is
> full.
